Welcome to Fellow (because it's Penn LABs - badum tss) - a trello API clone.

## Stack

This project was mostly written using ES6 features on top of a Node environment.

### Front end

1. Bulma for making forms look pretty.

## Back end

1. [Express](https://expressjs.com) for server (npm has a great ecosystem).
2. [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) for database (although the data is technically relational, NoSQL is fast to develop with and the schema dictates document-level references anyway).
3. [JWT/Passport](https://jwt.io/) for authentication (extra feature talked about at length in Documentation section).

## Notable changes

1. The `id`s of cards and lists are immutable strings (not `int`s) as per MongoDB's standard schemas.
2. The `edit` routes have been changed to `/card/edit/:cardId` and `/list/edit/:listId` for consistency.
3. I added a `/card/all` route to return all cards made by the user.
4. I added a `/list/all` route to return all lists made by the user (useful for debugging).
5. I added timestamps using a `createdAt` field to all documents.
6. I added an author field using `creator` to all documents.

## DevOps

Server hosted on Ubuntu instance on AWS (so you don't have to clone the repo - but you can still `yarn && yarn start` if you want). Link in repo description. Database hosted using MLab free tier.

All environment variables are located in `.env` (I know this is isn't safe but I trust you guys), including `PORT`, `DB_URI` and `SECRET` (key used to sign tokens).

## Documentation

The code is commented but this section aims to provide a high-level overview of the project structure.

### Server Behaviour

0. Project is split into `/server` and `/client` folders. Project starts at `server/index.js` when running `yarn start`. 
1. Schemas for users, cards, and lists are in the `/server/models` folder with their own respective files linked together `/server/models/index.js` when connecting to the MongoDB instance.
2. 

### Security

Tokens are used to authenticate routes in a stateless manner and are signed using the 256 bit secret found in `.env` (can be set to arbitrary length). The procedure for token authentication in Fellow is as follows:

1. User creates account using `/signup` route. Password is hashed using bcrypt and is stored.
2. User signs in using `/login` route. Provided password is hashed using bcrypt and is compared. If match, then token is generated by signing a payload of user's `_id` and username using a 256 bit secret.
4. An `Authorization` header MUST be set to a signed token in order for protected routes (`/card/*` and `/list/*`) to be made.
5. Upon logout (or after 2 hours) tokens must be regenerated.
